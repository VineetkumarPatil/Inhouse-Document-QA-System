Internal Notes

RAG System Overview
The document QA system uses a retrieval-augmented generation approach. Documents are ingested, chunked, embedded, and stored in a vector database.

Ingestion Flow
1. Load text files from the documents directory
2. Split text into overlapping chunks
3. Generate embeddings for each chunk
4. Store embeddings in the vector store

Chunking Strategy
Chunks should be between 300 and 600 tokens with an overlap of 50 tokens to preserve context.

Embedding Model
The embedding model converts text into numerical vectors suitable for similarity search.

Query Flow
User queries are embedded and compared against stored vectors. The most relevant chunks are retrieved and passed to the language model.

Known Limitations
- Answers are limited to ingested documents
- Outdated documents may produce incorrect answers
- Poor chunking can reduce retrieval accuracy

Future Improvements
- Add document metadata
- Support PDF and DOCX files
- Add versioning for documents
